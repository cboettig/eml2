# eml2


The goal of `eml2` is to provide both a drop-in replacement for the higher-level functions of the existing EML package while also providing additional functionality.  

`eml2` attempts to provide a rewrite of the EML R package based on a simple list structure (S3 classes).  EML's S4 class system made developing methods both clumsy and difficult.
